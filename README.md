# Spreadsheet
Functional Programming is a popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, developers organize code into smaller functions, then combine these functions to create complex programs.

In this spreadsheet application project, we learned about parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing spreadsheet functions, handling cell references, and creating interactive web interfaces. We learned how to dynamically update the page based on user input.

This project will cover concepts such as the map(), find(), and includes() methods, and the parseInt() function.
